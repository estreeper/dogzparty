About

This is a sample project to go with a presentation on the basics of GraphQL and how it works.

DISCLAIMER: I believe this to be a terrible business idea. Undertake at your own risk.

You will need Node and NPM installed. After that, just
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
and the server will be available at http://localhost:3333/graphql
